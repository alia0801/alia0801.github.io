We introduce ACCEPT, a geospatial decision support system that merges robust, intuitive visualization with grid-based data processing and neural networks to enhance spatial data analysis and interpretation in context-sensitive scenarios. It offers versatile machine learning modules with multiple prediction models, tailored to specific requirements with user-defined configurable parameters and flexible predictive target selection. The system serves as an accessible introduction to geographic information systems (GIS) for the general public. The system maps Points of Interest (POIs) to grids, simplifying processes like weighting, intersection, and interpolation, enhancing data accessibility and manipulation. Our case studies show effective handling of spatial data, reflecting similar distribution patterns of POIs, spatial separation, local feature sensitivity, and proximity to infrastructure and kernel size affect evaluations. The extensible and user-friendly web interface includes geospatial data inquiries, overlay, import/export, statistic, and multiple map views, facilitating informed decisions in resource distribution and urban planning. It supports urban planners, analysts, and policymakers in achieving equitable resource distribution and enhancing residential justice, while also providing non-experts an introduction to advanced geospatial analyses, promoting wider engagement and understanding in spatial decision-making.
